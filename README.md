# Tasks
0. The presentation
mandatory
```
You will present your project individually or as a team on a zoom call.

Your presentation, inclusive of the demo, should not exceed 16 minutes. You are expected to provide the following:

A public GitHub repository for your project.
A Google Slides presentation including:
A brief description of the project and your team.
A breakdown of the architecture and the technologies or third-party services used.
A report of your developments, highlighting your successes, challenges, areas for improvement, lessons learned, and next steps for your project.
A conclusion summarizing your experience.
Remember, the presentation is a vital part of your project completion, so be sure to include it in your planning to avoid any delays in submission.
```
1. Video Demo of your project
mandatory
```
Alongside your project presentation, we require a short video demo, no longer than 3 minutes, that showcases the essential features of your project, illustrating how they all work together. This could take the form of a user walkthrough.

We’ve created a tutorial video to inspire you with our expectations. Think of it as an inspirational tool, not a strict template, designed to help you effectively showcase your brilliant work. Your creativity and individual touch will make your demo even more engaging.

## A few points to consider while preparing your video:

+ Maximum Video Duration: The video should not exceed 3 minutes, ensuring it is concise and engaging.

+ Background Music: If you include background music, ensure it’s copyright-free to avoid potential legal issues.

+ Voice-Overs: Feel free to use your voice to guide us through your project. Ensure your voice is clear, audible, and not overshadowed by the background music.

## Recommended Tools: We suggest using

+ Recording: Zoom(record + screenshare), Loom, Camtasia, etc
+ Editing tools such as: Filmora Wondershare, Camtasia for your video creation.
+ How to share: YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, use a similar site), or a cloud storage service (G-drive, One-drive, etc). Submit the URL of your video. Make sure your video is accessible to the public - On YouTube, it’s fine to flag it as “unlisted,” but don’t flag it as “private”
## Please note that your project will not be considered complete without this video submission. It forms an integral part of your final project assessment.

+ So, let’s see your creativity in action.

+ We are eagerly awaiting your presentations and demo videos.

+ Happy building,
